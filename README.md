*** STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT ***

This is a blog website I've created to further my skills using the MERN stack. It is also for my own personal use to show my build threads of my cars which are posted on forums, as forums are slowly starting to phase out I thought it's a perfect time to start a blog so I can continue the story of each car.
